It's supposed to use a python3 interpreter
callable with the python3 executable.
If you have a different executable name
for python3 (such as python or python 3.7 or so)
change it accordingly with the actual interpreter name.

# stdin.py
# usage:

echo "this is a sentence" | python3 stdin.py

printf "these \n are different \n words" | python3 stdin.py

seq 15 | python3 stdin.py
